# COVID-19-hivemind
Let's take a collaborative approach to stop COVID-19's global spread.

Data set made available here, along with a call to action: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/call-action-tech-community-new-machine-readable-covid-19-dataset/

Language of choice: Python 3.x

We should develop with the end user and actionable products in mind, for instance
a web app that can assist first responders.

Expecting pull-requests as soon as possible by the global machine learning / ai / hacker commununity.
